          <h1>This Project is a tribute to Rorochan_1999 and all victims of Cybercrime</h1>
          <p>
            Rorochan_1999 was a Japanese teenage livestreamer from
             Ōmihachiman, Shiga Prefecture, who gained attention online between 2012 and 2013 
             through platforms like Nico Nico Douga, FC2, and Twitter. Known for her piano performances, 
             singing, and interactions with viewers, she gradually developed a following and became somewhat of a net idol. 
             However, as her popularity grew, so did the signs of emotional distress. She began engaging in increasingly dangerous
              behavior during her streams, allegedly in a pursuit to gain more attention and secure her place as an “internet legend.”
               Viewers witnessed her emotional decline as she exhibited unstable behavior, often crying or laughing uncontrollably during live sessions, 
               while also referencing conflict at home, potential bullying, and other struggles.

            The tragedy culminated on November 24, 2013, when Rorochan livestreamed what would be her final moments. 
            During the stream, visibly distressed and wearing a mask, she aimed the camera over the edge of her 13th-floor balcony as viewers watched in confusion and horror. 
            Despite some viewers trying to help, others reportedly encouraged her fatal decision. She ultimately jumped, and the stream captured the camera falling and the
             sound of her impact. Though her story briefly received online memorials and discussions, it faded from mainstream attention, 
             becoming yet another heartbreaking example of a young person overwhelmed by the pressures of internet culture and personal turmoil.
