      title: "Friendly Fire",
      synopsis: "Friendly Fire illustrates the digital decomposition of a college friend group perpetrated in the person of Jhill, well-intentioned student, who blindly finds herself as the target of persistent cyberbullying under the disguise of friendly jokes. What starts off as playful banter quickly deteriorates into exclusion, anonymous harassment, and emotional manipulation in this all too real 'game', substantiated by group chats, memes, and hidden group threads. Jhill is left to contend with betrayal, mental anguish, and loneliness as the blurred lines between friendship and malice become increasingly impossible to navigate all while her so-called friends diminish the experience by laughing it off as 'just a joke'. Told through screen recordings and chat messages only, Friendly Fire is a compelling cautionary tale of today's digital world about the deadly consequences of digital trauma, and the silence of peers when witnessing or experiencing bullying.",
